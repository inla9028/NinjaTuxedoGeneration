Tuxedo differences CSM vs Ninja
-------------------------------

csLsNpTrx (input)
-----------------
This seems to work fine (and note that it's the output that's changed for 15.2). However there are minor differences in the input.

a) We still send the Directive. CSM no longer does this.
b) CSM has ENV_CODE NTCNENV5, while we always have PRDENV. This is not a big deal, but it would be nice if Ninja got this from the system defaults (via the/a system defauls reference table class), or even from Fokus itself - does it have a system properties we could load the value from (into a fokus system properties class)?
c) CSM sends RUN_DATE 20091214 - we don't!!
d) While it clearly doesn't matter (assuming that we do have them when they have an actual value), Ninja is missing all of these:
USER_ID	0
EXT_ORDER_ID	0
FROM_DATE	 <space>
TO_DATE	 <space>
INITI_ORDER_TP	 <space>
BUFFER_SIZE	0
ORDID_STR	 <space>
ORIGINATING_NUMBER	 <space>
TEMPORARY_MSISDN	 <space>


csGetCtnNm (input)
------------------
This seems to work fine too, although one thing is making me nervous.
a) and b) above (csLsNpTrx) are true here too, although the run_date is set.

c) We set the hlr (to 01) in this case. CSM doesn't set it. (Do they filter in the client? Perhaps it defaults to 01 and they set it for SPs?)

d) **** We still set CTN_PATTERN to 047*, CSM is now setting it to "047%%%%%%%%" ****

e) CSM sets PAGESIZE to 10, Ninja sets it to 0.
The output, apart from a couple of the actual available numbers being different, is identical though.


CsChkValImp (input)
-------------------
This seems to work fine too. Neither CSM nor Ninja sends the LOCATION_ID (which is the new 15.2 field, and it only for Telia)
a) and b) above (csLsNpTrx) are true here too, although the run_date is set.

c) We send ACCTYPE (B) and ACCSUBTYPE (R) while CSM didn't (for the particular transaction I did).

d) *** we send NUMBER_TYPE P, CSM sends @ (but that was for an NP Best)

Fokus 13.5 Tuxedo services
--------------------------

Services changed:

 
csMoveCtn
 - new field PCTNCNCLBUFROW_COUNT inserted at 377
 - 23 IN fields have had their field_max_occurence increased from 1 to 25: act_code, act_reason, charge_amt, charge_amt_ind, <memo fields>, rms_act_code, susp_rc_rate_type, waive_ind, waive_reason.

So only 1 class is updated: CsMoveCtnInput.java


Jolt port on env 1 (on tuxtst1) is 22130
(ST on old machine is 22380)

csMoveCtn - both changes are to do with supporting multiple memos (for Telia Denmark?)
---------
a) existing field ROW_COUNT moved from seq 376 to 152. This shuffles everything else up. A new field PCTNCNCLBUFROW_COUNT inserted in place of the old one - at 377 now due to shuffle up.
*** Looks like this requires some recoding: I don't think the new field can be null. ***

b) 23 IN fields have had their field_max_occurence increased from 1 to 25: act_code, act_reason, charge_amt, charge_amt_ind, <memo fields>, rms_act_code, susp_rc_rate_type, waive_ind, waive_reason.
(This is the same set of fields that were increased from 2 to 25 for arSvBanSvc in the last release.)
*** Because we are going from single to multiple this requires some recoding. ***

Files taken from /NTC_D/lib on fokustest on 05/11/07. 

The files were (originally) dated 02/11/07 (13:16, 13:28 - 13:31).

The list of services listed in tlgntc.in appears to be unchanged. In any case I had no reason to believe that the set of online services had been increased or decreased.

The number of olr files is 990 - same as for Fokus 12.0

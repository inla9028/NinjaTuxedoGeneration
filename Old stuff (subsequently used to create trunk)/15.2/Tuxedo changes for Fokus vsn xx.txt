1. Any services changed (does counts and matches fields by sequence)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

3 services:

All in use:

a) csChkValImp
i) To do a failed transaction:
   Open up np control window (button on lhs)... cancel (on the retrieval criteria), click "Send Trx" button (lhs) and select "105 NP-BEST-Bestilling av nr er" for the Transaction - ie to do a best, use an external number (clean port in) in Main Number... This gives you a "Number is used by external operator. Please perform port in activity using new subscriber/additional number reservation."
ii) To do a successful transaction:
    PROBABLY HAVE TO DO RESERVE (WITH AN EXTERNAL NUMBER)
Open the add new subscriber box and enter the dealer / sales agaent. Click the NP Info button (in the subscriber section - top right of box). Select something external (eg " 734 Telenor Mobil" for Current Operator). Enter an unused external number (something like 900-00-021) and hit tab or save or something.

b) csGetCtnNm
   This is yer normal "get me x (10 usually) numbers" as used when reserving a bog-standard subscription.

c) csLsNpTrx
   Open up np control window and type in a suitable number. One that's never been used will come back with very little. One that has been ported (eg one from a previous regression test) will produce some results.
